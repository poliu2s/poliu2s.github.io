Disaster	Natural	Geological	Landslide	Khyex River BC	28/11/2003 12:00:00 AM	Khyex River BC, November 28, 2003. The Khyex River Landslide occurred on November 28, 2003 between 00:20 and 00:30 PST. This is when Pacific Northern Gas Ltd noticed a pressure loss in the pipeline. Approximately 300 m of 8-inch pipeline was lost. As a result, most of Prince Rupert residents were without natural gas or heat for 10 days. A few days after the landslide occurred, a temporary 2-inch gas line was installed to restore partial service. This is a spectacular landslide because it not only flowed downstream, but crossed the river and flowed upstream for hundreds of metres. This type of landslide took place in very sensitive glaciomarine muds, and is called a retrogressive earthflow. The estimated volume of material displaced by the landslide is up to 4.7 million cubic metres. It is thought that the slope failure was triggered by erosion of the riverbank.	0	0	0			28/11/2003 12:00:00 AM	0.0000	0.0000						0	0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Wildfire	Kelowna, Kamloops and Cariboo BC	18/07/2009 12:00:00 AM	Kelowna, Kamloops and Cariboo BC, July 18, 2009.  Fire season 2009 had 3,049 fires, 213 of which were wildland-urban interface fires. On July 18, fires broke out in the Glenrosa and Rose Valley communities of West Kelowna, combined with the Terrace Mountain fire west of Fintry, which led to multiple evacuation orders and alerts. July also saw an abundance of lightning storms leading to other fires of note throughout the province. Temperatures continued to break record highs and little precipitation was received in most areas. As September began, all personnel continued to work hard to contain fires across the Kamloops and Cariboo regions. The Lava Canyon fire, the largest, was nearly 55,000 hectares and growing.  There were over 100 notable fires during this fire season: at least 27 caused evacuation orders and at least a dozen more caused evacuation alerts.  Approximately 20,000 people were evacuated. One helicopter pilot lost his life in the line of duty.	1	0	20000	75000000.0000	3933566.4	18/07/2009 12:00:00 AM	58000000.0000	17000000.0000						0	0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Storms and Severe Thunderstorms	Ottawa, Toronto and Windsor ON	25/04/2009 12:00:00 AM	Ottawa, Toronto and Windsor ON, April 25, 2009. A spate of fierce thunderstorms broke out across southwestern, southcentral and eastern Ontario. Winds at Toronto Pearson International Airport gusted to 115 km/h, the strongest wind gust reported since January 1978. Power lines and trees came down across the province, knocking out power to 100,000 customers.  Embedded in the thunderstorm cluster were marble-sized hail near Parry Sound, waterspouts in the Ottawa River, straight-line winds and weak tornados in Windsor and Ottawa. In Windsor, the roof was ripped off a union hall building with chunks of roofing and shards of glass littering the lawn and front steps. At Ottawa's Rockcliffe Flying Club, winds damaged 18 planes. Both tornados were F0 in intensity with winds of up to 110 km/h.	0	0	0			25/04/2009 12:00:00 AM								300000	0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Tornado	Toronto, Windsor, Vaughan and Newmarket ON	20/08/2009 12:00:00 AM	Toronto, Windsor, Vaughan and Newmarket ON, August 20, 2009.  A supercell storm developed just south of Lake Huron and tracked northeastward for a remarkable 200 km. The heat and humidity hanging over Ontario increased once the clouds disappeared.  At the same time, a squall line developed over Lower Michigan and traveled across Ontario. This system produced straight-line winds from Windsor to northeast of Toronto and destructive tornados in Vaughan and Newmarket. While these tornados were wreaking havoc just north of Toronto, another series of supercell thunderstorms was spawning tornados in portions of Simcoe County, Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts to the east of Georgian Bay, and north towards Lake Nipissing. In total, the day's weather produced 19 confirmed tornadoes, including: four F0, eleven F1, and four F2. That was the greatest number of F2 tornadoes in Ontario in one day since the Barrie/Central Ontario tornadoes of May 31, 1985. It was also a new Canadian record for the most confirmed tornadoes in one day. Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing an 11-year-old boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp.  About 600 homes, mostly in the communities of Maple and Woodbridge, were damaged. Thirty-eight were demolished and declared unsafe. Major flooding occurred along the lakeshore, and at the peak of the storm Hydro One reported that 69,000 customers had lost power.	1	0	0			20/08/2009 12:00:00 AM								207000	0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Storms and Severe Thunderstorms	South-East Alberta	02/08/2009 12:00:00 AM	South-East Alberta, August 2, 2009. A powerful storm moved out of the Rocky foothills and tracked southeastward across the province with wind and hail that left a devastating path of destruction. The main hail zone scarped the extreme northeastern portion of Calgary. Inside the city, hail diameters reached baseball size and wind speeds peaked at 107 km/h. The storm left downed trees, broken windows and a swath of damage, knocking out power to several thousand customers. In some places, hail measured 10 cm deep. The nearby town of Carstairs was devastated by the battering large hail. Hail damage stretched from Olds to Bow Island and was 55 km wide in places.	0	0	0			02/08/2009 12:00:00 AM								9999	0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Notre-Dame-des-Prairies	28/06/2009 12:00:00 AM	During the week from June 28 to July 4, a quasi-stationary low-pressure system stalled over eastern Ontario and Quebec. Excessive rains of 140 mm damaged roads and bridges, and flooded basements.  The hardest hit areas were in Charlevoix, Mauricie and Parent. Flood waters filled 50 houses in Notre-Dame-des-Prairies on July 1, and collapsed a street in Entrelacs when a stream overflowed. The flow rate on several rivers exceeded historic records.	0	0	0			04/07/2009 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Storms and Severe Thunderstorms	Hamilton and Toronto ON	26/07/2009 12:00:00 AM	Hamilton and Toronto ON, July 26, 2009. A storm cell stalled over the western end of Lake Ontario. Hamilton was hard hit. Waves of thunderstorms pounded the city, leaving citizens with flooded basements and motorists stuck in traffic caused by road closures. The midday downpour turned Red Hill Creek into an angry brown torrent that forced the closure of nearby roads and highways. Water gushed into 7,000 basements and power was shut off to thousands of customers. While the Hamilton Airport observed only 28 mm of rain, radar estimates confirmed rainfall amounts in an unofficial gauge totaling 109 mm in two hours - worse than a 100-year storm and one of the most intense short-duration rainfalls on record in Canada. Conditions were made worse because the ground was super-saturated from storms two days earlier. In Toronto, parts of Lakeshore Boulevard near the Exhibition grounds were submerged. To the north, a pair of giant sinkholes swallowed part of Finch Avenue West - big enough to hold a fleet of cars and deep enough to cover a four-storey building.	0	0	0			26/07/2009 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Tornado	Déléage to Mont-Laurier	04/08/2009 12:00:00 AM	Déléage to Mont-Laurier, August 4, 2009. The season's most powerful tornado occurred along a track from Déléage, through Aumond, to Mont-Laurier in the upper Laurentians. It blew away roofs, pushed over walls, tossed cars around, snapped utility poles and downed power lines leaving 4,000 without power. Among the 40 damaged homes in Mont-Laurier, 28 were rendered uninhabitable. There were no serious injuries. The tornado caused about $6 million in insured losses. The tornado's path through Mont-Laurier was 300 m wide, but its 40-km track was an unusually long distance for a tornado in Quebec and a strong indication of the storm's severity. The last time a stronger tornado touched down in the province was on the same day in 1994 when an F3 tornado destroyed more than 400 homes in Aylmer.	0	0	0	6000000.0000	314685.3	04/08/2009 12:00:00 AM						6000000.0000		12000	0.0

Approximately 330,000 hectares burned due to 1,673 fires.  Over 1,400 personnel from out-of-province assisted with fighting the fires.  Two airtanker pilots died when their plane crashed.  Both the city of Vancouver and the Government of Alberta issued air quality warnings due to smoke caused by the fires.	2	0		220000000.0000	11330472.1	08/09/2010 12:00:00 AM			220000000.0000					0	0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB	24/03/2009 12:00:00 AM	Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB, March 24, 2009. Overland flooding from March 24 to May 21 caused by a combination of snowmelt, seasonal precipitation and the spring breakup affected southern Manitoba's watershed areas of the Red, Pembina, Assiniboine, and Souris Rivers.  The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk.  The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.	0	0	3000	40000000.0000	2097902.1	21/05/2009 12:00:00 AM	33500000.0000	6500000.0000						0	0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Drought	Saskatchewan and Alberta	01/03/2009 12:00:00 AM	Saskatchewan and Alberta, March 2009.  The Canadian Wheat Board projected lower crop prospects by 20 per cent across the Prairies. A dozen counties and municipal districts in Alberta declared a state of drought emergency or disaster.  For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasn't just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Alberta's capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent. Not surprisingly, the flow of the North Saskatchewan River was at its third lowest level in nearly a century.	0	0	0			01/03/2009 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0

A severe storm hit St. John's with winds of up to 220 km/h and left 55 cm of snow on the ground.  An avalanche struck two houses and swept them down the slope, hitting two other houses.  Over 50 rescue workers and residents worked for 12 hours, digging through the snow and the debris to free trapped residents.  In the Outer Battery, another avalanche (caused by the same storm) buried a house that withheld the weight of the snow.  The strong structure protected the residents; however, they were trapped until dug out by rescue workers.  This was the second avalanche to affect The Battery in 40 years.  Inspection of the slopes has shown that a rockfall risk exists, and that The Battery is frequently affected by rockfalls.  The City of St. John's has recently constructed safety fences to protect against rockfalls and avalanches in the Outer Battery area.	5	9	0			16/02/1959 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0
